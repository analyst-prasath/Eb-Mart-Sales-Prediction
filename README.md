# EBMart Sales Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict sales for EBMart, an e-commerce platform, using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project contains historical sales data, including various features such as product attributes, customer information, and time-related variables.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the "sales_data.csv" dataset, which includes information about the sales transactions on EBMart. It contains features such as product ID, customer demographics, purchase date, product attributes, and sales quantity.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the sales for EBMart based on the available features. The project will involve the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: This step involves exploring the dataset, understanding the features, and handling any missing or inconsistent data. Data cleaning, feature selection, and feature engineering may also be performed to prepare the data for model training.

2. **Feature Engineering**: In this step, we will analyze the existing features and create new features that can potentially improve the predictive power of the model. This may include transforming categorical variables, encoding customer behavior, or extracting temporal features.

3. **Model Selection and Training**: Various machine learning algorithms, such as regression or time series models, will be evaluated and compared to select the best model for this task. The dataset will be split into training and testing sets, and the chosen model will be trained using the training data.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model will be evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics to assess its performance and accuracy. This step will help in understanding how well the model generalizes to unseen data and predicts sales for EBMart.

5. **Sales Prediction**: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict future sales for EBMart. This will enable the platform to make informed decisions related to inventory management, pricing strategies, and customer engagement.
